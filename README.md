# Hello Person, I'm Waulta

Amateur Software Developer currently expanding my knowledge on Web Development.

## About me:
Throughout my life, I have always had a passion for technology, whether it be making video games, playing them, or pulling the consoles themselves apart. 
However, the one thing that has always interested me is programming. I began experimenting with applications such as Game Maker, Scratch, & GameSalad. Those were all visual scripting based, so I didn't learn anything too useful. 

During those times, I also messed with JavaScript here and there, both for Minecraft Pocket Edition Modding and personal projects for practice, but those were only very minor and are lost to time. 
After that, I took a few years off from programming to focus on music. I was planning to go to university to study music, but since COVID-19 hit, those opportunities have been taken away until further notice.

Since then I have joined the "GorillaTag Modding" Discord server and started learning C++ to make Oculus Quest mods. However, since cheaters ruined it all, I have switched to PCVR Modding & Unity game development, which uses the C# language. I have made multiple mod/game prototypes, but they are not "good" enough to be publicly accessible. 

Recently, I have released two mods for PCVR. ByeByeDebugLog, which is a simple optimization that I spent about 10 minutes working on, & Monke Bazooka, which is a mod that I spent over a month working on and tweaking.
Currently, I'm studying multiple programming languages in hopes of turning this whole thing into a career one day, but that might just be a dream.
